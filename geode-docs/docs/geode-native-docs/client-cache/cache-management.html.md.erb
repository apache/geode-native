-   **[Client-to-Server Connection Process](client-to-server-connection.html)**

    It is important to understand the sequence of events that occur when the native client connects with a Geode cache server.

-   **[Controlling Cache Size](controlling-cache-size.html)**

    You can control cache size through region size limits, cache size limits, or a combination of the two.

-   **[Managing the Lifetime of a Cached Object](managing-lifetime-cached-object.html)**

    All cacheable objects derive from `SharedBase` , which provides reference counting. Cacheable objects are referenced using `SharedPtr` types.

-   **[Using Thread Safety in Cache Management](using-thread-safety.html)**

    When you perform structural changes on your cache, such as creating or closing a `Cache`, `Pool`, or `Region`, synchronize your operations or do them in a single thread.

-   **[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html)**

    This section provides troubleshooting information for the native client.
