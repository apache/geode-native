Region attributes govern the automated management of a region and its entries.

Region attribute settings determine where the data resides, how the region is managed in memory, and the automatic loading, distribution, and expiration of region entries.

## <a id="specifying-region-attributes"></a>Specifying Region Attributes

Specify region attributes before creating the region. You can do this either through the API or
through the declarative XML file. The API includes classes for defining a region's attributes before
creation and for modifying some of them after creation. For details, see the API for
`RegionShortcut`, `RegionAttributes`, `AttributesFactory`, and `AttributesMutator`.

## <a id="region-shortcuts"></a>Region Shortcuts

<%=vars.product_name%> provides predefined, shortcut region attributes settings for your use in `RegionShortcut`.

Shortcut attributes are a convenience only. They are named attributes that <%=vars.product_name%>
has already stored for you. You can override their settings by storing new attributes with the same
`id` as the predefined attributes.

### <a id="region-shortcuts_shortcut-attribute-options"></a>Shortcut Attribute Options

You can select the most common region attributes settings from `RegionShortcut`, the predefined named region attributes.

This section provides an overview of the options available in the region shortcut settings.

**Communication with Servers and Data Storage**

`PROXY`
>  does not store data in the client cache, but connects the region to the servers for data requests and updates, interest registrations, and so on.

`CACHING_PROXY`
>  stores data in the client cache and connects the region to the servers for data requests and updates, interest registrations, and so on.

`LOCAL`
>  stores data in the client cache and does not connect the region to the servers. This is a client-side-only region.

**Data Eviction**

Non-PROXY regions are those that store data in the client cache.
You can add data eviction for non-PROXY regions:

`ENTRY_LRU`
>  causes least recently used data to be evicted from memory when the region reaches the entry count limit.
