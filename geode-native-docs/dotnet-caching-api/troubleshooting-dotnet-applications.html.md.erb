The .NET Framework does not find managed DLLs using the conventional `PATH` environment variable. In order for your assembly to find and load a managed DLL, it must either be loaded as a private assembly using `assemblyBinding`, or it must be installed into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

The GAC utility must be run on every machine that runs the .NET code.

If an assembly attempts to load the `Apache.Geode.Client.dll` without meeting this requirement, a `System.IO.FileNotFoundException` will be thrown.
