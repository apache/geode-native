The `OperationContext` object that is passed to the `authorizeOperation` method of the callback as the second argument provides an `isPostOperation` method that returns true when the callback is invoked in the post-operation phase.

For example:

``` pre
bool authorizeOperation(Region region, OperationContext context) {
    if (context.isPostOperation()) {
        //it's a post-operation
    } else {
        //it's a pre-operation
    }
}
```

If an authorization failure occurs in a pre-operation or post-operation callback on the server, the operation throws a `NotAuthorizedException` on the client.

For more information, see [Authorization](geodeman/managing/security/authorization_overview.html).
