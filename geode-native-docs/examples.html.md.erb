title:  Programming Examples
---

The <%=vars.product_name%> Client build provides a set of programming examples to help you understand the client API.
The `examples` directory contains CMake files and a `cpp` subdirectory containing C++ examples.
The Windows build also includes a `dotnet` subdirectory containing C# examples.

CMake files are located at each level of the directory structure to allow examples to be built individually or in groups.

The directory structure resembles this hierarchy (some entries are omitted for clarity):

    MyProject/
      cmake/
      CMakeLists.txt
      examples/
        BUILDING.md
        CMakeLists.txt
        CMakeLists.txt.in
        cmake/
        cpp/
          BUILDING.md
          customserializable/
          customserializer/
          put-get-remove/
        dotnet/
          AuthInitialize/
          PdxAutoSerializer/
          PutGetRemove/
          README.md

See the `BUILDING.md` or `README.md` file in each directory for detailed instructions on building
and executing the examples, and read the source code to understand how the examples are constructed.
