PDX serialized instances in Java map to .NET types with the same name. If you need to adjust the .NET name, then you need to use the IPdxTypeMapper.

See the [Java to .NET Type Mapping Table](../../dotnet-caching-api/java-to-dotnet-type-mapping.html#concept_24D0AAC71FF1483AB47A7772DA018966) for current mappings.

## Using IPdxTypeMapper

``` pre
//This demonstrates, how to map .NET type to pdx type or java type
public class PdxTypeMapper : IPdxTypeMapper {
    
    public string ToPdxTypeName(string localTypeName) {
        return "pdx_" + localTypeName;
    }

    public string FromPdxTypeName(string pdxTypeName) {
        return pdxTypeName.Substring(4);//need to extract "pdx_"
    }
}
```
