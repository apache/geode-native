Built-in .NET types are serialized automatically into the cache and can be retrieved by Java servers and other <%=vars.product_name%> clients. For domain objects that are not simple types, you have three <%=vars.product_name%> serialization options.

The options give good performance and flexibility for data storage, transfers, and language types. The <%=vars.product_name%> options can also improve performance in serializing and deserializing built-in types.

The simplest option is to use perform automatic serialization by registering the <%=vars.product_name%> .NET PDX reflection-based autoserializer in your application. When you have this registered, <%=vars.product_name%> uses it for all domain objects that are not custom serialized.

You can also custom serialize your objects by implementing one of the <%=vars.product_name%> .NET interfaces, `Apache.Geode.Client.IPdxSerializable` or `Apache.Geode.Client.IDataSerializable`.

You also have the option of using default .NET serialization, but you cannot use it unless you also use helper classes. The helper classes you must use are `CacheableObject` and `CacheableObjectXml`.

<%=vars.product_name%> .NET PDX serialization has more bytes in overhead than <%=vars.product_name%> .NET Data serialization, but using PDX serialization helps you avoid the performance costs of deserialization when performing queries. Applications can use `PdxInstances` in functions to avoid the deserialization of entire objects.

\*You can mix domain object versions where the differences between versions are the addition and removal of object fields.

By default, you can use <%=vars.product_name%> delta propagation with PDX serialization. However, delta propagation will not work if you have set the <%=vars.product_name%> property read-serialized to "true". In terms of deserialization, to apply a change delta propagation requires a domain class instance and the `fromDelta` method. If you have set read-serialized to true, you will receive an `IPdxInstance` instead of a domain class instance and `IPdxInstance` does not have the `fromDelta` method required for delta propagation. You will also require the Java domain class on the server similar to the you would need the .NET PDX Delta domain class.
