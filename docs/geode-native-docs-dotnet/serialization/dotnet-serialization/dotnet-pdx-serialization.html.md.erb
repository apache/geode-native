<%=vars.product_name%>'s Portable Data eXchange (PDX) is a cross-language data format that can reduce the cost of distributing and serializing your objects. PDX stores data in named fields that you can access individually, to avoid the cost of deserializing the entire data object. PDX also allows you to mix versions of objects where you have added or removed fields.

You have two options for <%=vars.product_name%> PDX serialization when using the .NET caching API. You can program your domain objects using the `IPdxSerializable` interface, or you can use <%=vars.product_name%>â€™s reflection-based autoserializer.
