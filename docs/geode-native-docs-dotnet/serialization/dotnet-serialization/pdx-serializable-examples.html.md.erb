The native client release contain an example showing how a client application
can register for serialization of domain objects using the .NET IPdxSerializable interface.

The example is located in `examples\dotnet\pdxserializable`.

The example defines the serializable class, `Orders`, including its serialization and deserialization methods and its factory method.
Once these pieces are in place, execution is simple: the main routine of the example registers the serializable class then performs some Put and Get operations.

## Execution

The example performs a sequence of operations, displaying simple log entries as they run.

- To run the example, follow the instructions in the README.md file in the example directory.

- Review the source code in the example directory to see exactly how it operates.

- Begin by running a script that sets up the server-side environment by invoking `gfsh` commands to create a region, a locator, and a server.

- Run the example client application, which performs the following steps:

  - Connects to the server
  - Registers the PdxSerializable class
  - Creates orders
  - Stores orders
  - Retrieves orders

## .NET Example

This section contains code snippets showing highlights of the .NET PdxSerializable example. They are not intended for cut-and-paste execution.
For the complete source, see the example source directory.

The .NET example defines a PdxSerializable class called `Order` that inherits from the `IPdxSerializable` interface.
An `Order` object contains three fields:

- an integer `order_id`
- a string `name`
- a short-int `quantity`

From Order.cs:

```csharp
  public class Order : IPdxSerializable
  {
    ...
    public long OrderId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public short Quantity { get; set; }
```

Using the `IPdxSerializable` read and write methods, the `Order` class defines `ToData()` and `FromData()`
methods that perform the serialization and deserialization operations, respectively, and the `CreateDeserializable()` factory method:

From Order.cs:

```csharp
    public void ToData(IPdxWriter output)
    {
      output.WriteLong(ORDER_ID_KEY_, OrderId);
      output.MarkIdentityField(ORDER_ID_KEY_);

      output.WriteString(NAME_KEY_, Name);
      output.MarkIdentityField(NAME_KEY_);

      output.WriteInt(QUANTITY_KEY_, Quantity);
      output.MarkIdentityField(QUANTITY_KEY_);
    }

    public void FromData(IPdxReader input)
    {
      OrderId = input.ReadLong(ORDER_ID_KEY_);
      Name = input.ReadString(NAME_KEY_);
      Quantity = (short)input.ReadInt(QUANTITY_KEY_);
    }

    public static IPdxSerializable CreateDeserializable()
    {
      return new Order();
    }
```

The .NET example mainline creates a cache, then uses it to register the PdxSerializable class that was created in Orders.cs:

```csharp
var cache = new CacheFactory()
    .Set("log-level", "none")
    .Create();

   cache.TypeRegistry.RegisterPdxType(Order.CreateDeserializable);
```

The client creates a connection pool and a region named "example_orderobject":

```csharp
cache.GetPoolManager()
    .CreateFactory()
    .AddLocator("localhost", 10334)
    .Create("pool");

   var regionFactory = cache.CreateRegionFactory(RegionShortcut.PROXY)
        .SetPoolName("pool");
   var orderRegion = regionFactory.Create<int, Order>("example_orderobject");
```

After declaring some keys and values, the client then stores and retrieves an `Order` object:

```csharp
    const int orderKey = 65;

    var order = new Order(orderKey, "Donuts", 12);

    Console.WriteLine("order to put is " + order);
    orderRegion.Put(orderKey, order, null);

    Console.WriteLine("Successfully put order, getting now...");
    var orderRetrieved = orderRegion.Get(orderKey, null);

    Console.WriteLine("Order key: " + orderKey + " = " + orderRetrieved);
```

Finally, the application closes the cache:

```csharp
    cache.Close();
```
