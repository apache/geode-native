All data moving out of the client cache must be serializable.

-   **[Data Serialization Options](serialization-options.html)**

    The C++ client API provides two serialization options:  <%=vars.product_name%> PDX serialization and the `apache::geode::client::DataSerializable` interface.

-   **[Using PDX Serialization](pdx-serialization.html)**

    PDX is a cross-language data format that can reduce the cost of distributing and serializing your
objects. PDX stores data in named fields that you can access individually to avoid the cost of
deserializing the entire data object. When you use PDX serialization with a C++ client, you can
implement PDX serialization for each domain object or register a PdxSerializer for the entire cache.

-   **[Serializing Data with the DataSerializable Interface](serialization-using-serializable.html)**

    The C++ client API provides a `DataSerializable` interface that you can use for fast and compact data serialization. This section discusses the <%=vars.product_name%> DataSerializable interface and presents implementation examples.

-   **[Serializing Object Graphs](object-graphs.html)**

    If you have a graph of objects where each node can be serializable, the parent node can call `DataOutput::writeObject` to delegate the serialization responsibility to its child nodes. Similarly, your application can call `DataInput::readObject` to deserialize the object graph.

-   **[Serializing and Accessing Data as a Blob](data-as-blob.html)**

    If you have data that is best handled as a blob, such as structs that do not contain pointers, use the serializable type `CacheableBytes` . `CacheableBytes` is a blob class that implements the serialization for you.
