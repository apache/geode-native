Data in your client application's <%=vars.product_name%> cache must be serializable to be shared
with <%=vars.product_name%> servers and other <%=vars.product_name%> clients.
<%=vars.product_name%> provides multiple data serialization options for storage and transmittal
between processes, of which [**<%=vars.product_name%> Portable Data eXchange (PDX) serialization**](cpp-serialization/cpp-pdx-serialization.html))
offers the best combination of versatility and ease-of-use for most applications.

To learn more about other serialization options, see the [Data Serialization section in the
_<%=vars.product_name_long%> User Guide_](<%=vars.serverman%>/developing/data_serialization/chapter_overview.html).
