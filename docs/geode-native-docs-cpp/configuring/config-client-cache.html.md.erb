Client caches provide the framework for clients to store, manage, and distribute application data.

A cache is an entry point for access to <%=vars.product_name%>. Through the cache, clients gain
access to the <%=vars.product_name%> caching framework for data loading, distribution, and
maintenance.

A `Cache` instance allows your client to set general parameters for communication between a cache
and other caches in the distributed system, and to create and access any region in the cache.

Regions are created from `Cache` instances. Regions provide the entry points to the interfaces for
instances of `Region` and `RegionEntry`.

For more information specific to your client programming language, see the
[C++ Client API](cppapiref).
