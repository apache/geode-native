A variety of system properties can be specified when a client connects to a distributed system, either programmatically or in a `geode.properties` file.
See `apache::geode::client::SystemProperties` in the [C++ API docs](<%=vars.cppapiref%>/hierarchy.html).

The following settings can be configured:

-   **[General Properties](#general_props)**<br />Basic information for the process, such as cache creation parameters.
-   **[Logging Properties](#attributes-gfcpp__table_logging_props)**<br />How and where to log system messages.
-   **[Statistics Archiving Properties](#attributes-gfcpp__table_statistic_props)**<br />How to collect and archive statistics information.
-   **[Durable Client Properties](#attributes-gfcpp__table_durable_client_props)**<br />Information about the durable clients connected to the system.
-   **[System Properties for Client Authentication and Authorization](#attributes-gfcpp__table_security_props)**<br /> Information about various security parameters.
-   **[System Properties for High Availability](#attributes-gfcpp__table_high_availability_props)**<br />System properties to configure periodic acknowledgment (ack).

The following tables list attributes that can be specified programmatically or stored in the `geode.properties` file to be read by a client.

<li><strong>Warning</strong> is a potential problem in the system.</li>
<li><strong>Info</strong> is an informational message of interest to the end user and system administrator.</li>
<li><strong>Config</strong> is a static configuration message, often used to debug problems with particular configurations.</li>
