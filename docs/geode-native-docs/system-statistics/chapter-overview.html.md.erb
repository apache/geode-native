This section discusses statistics for caching and distribution activities.
Statistics that end with "time" are time-based statistics. 
For performance reasons, the system does not collect these by default.
To enable time-based statistics gathering,
set the system property `enable-time-statistics` 
as described in [Attributes in geode.properties—Statistics Archiving Properties](../setting-properties/propfile-attributes.html#attributes-gfcpp__table_E1A0EDBA67CD41319E1E5FD0A0BB2723).

-   **[Sampling Statistics](sampling-statistics.html)**

    When applications and cache servers join a distributed system, they indicate whether to enable statistics sampling and whether to archive the statistics that are gathered.

-   **[System Performance Statistics](system-performance-statistics.html)**

    Performance statistics are collected for each application or cache server that connects to a distributed system.

-   **[Operating System Statistics](operating-system-statistics.html)**

    Use operating system statistics to determine a member’s CPU, memory, and disk usage.
