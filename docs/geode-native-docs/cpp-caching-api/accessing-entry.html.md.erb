The `Region::get` method returns the value associated with the specified key, and passes the callback argument to any cache loaders or cache writers that are invoked in the operation.

If the value is not present locally, it is requested from the cache server. If the cache server request is unsuccessful, a local cache loader is invoked.

The entry value is either retrieved from the local cache or fetched by the region’s locally defined cache loader.

In the following example, the program uses the API to do a get for each entry that was put into the cache:

``` pre
for ( int32_t i=0; i< 100; i++) {
    CacheableInt32Ptr res = dynCast<CacheableInt32Ptr>(regionPtr->get(i));
}
```

You can use the `Region::getAll` methond to get values for an array of keys from the local cache or server. If the value for a key is not present locally, then it is requested from the server.

**Note:**
The value returned is not copied, so multi-threaded applications should not modify the value directly, but should instead use the update methods.

The `getAll` method also supports providing a callback argument to any cache loaders or cache writers that are invoked in the operation.
