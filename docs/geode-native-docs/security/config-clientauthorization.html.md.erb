You can configure authorization on a per-client basis for various cache operations such as create, get, put, query invalidations, interest registration, and region destroys. On the server side, the `securityclient-accessor` system property in the serverâ€™s `gemfire.properties` file specifies the authorization callback.

For example:

`security-client-accessor=templates.security.XmlAuthorization.create`

In this system property setting, `XmlAuthorization` is the callback class that implements the `AccessControl` interface. The `XmlAuthorization` sample implementation provided with Geode expects an XML file that defines authorization privileges for the clients. For details of this sample implementation and the `AccessControl` interface, see the [Authorization Example](../../managing/security/authorization_example.html#authorization_example).
