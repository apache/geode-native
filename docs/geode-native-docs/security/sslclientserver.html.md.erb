This section describes how to configure OpenSSL, implement SSL-based communication between your clients and servers, and run clients and servers with SSL enabled.

# Set Up OpenSSL

The open-source OpenSSL toolkit provides a full-strength general purpose cryptography library to operate along with the PKCS sample implementation for encrypted authentication of native client credentials.

Download and install OpenSSL 1.0.2 for your specific operating system.
For Windows platforms, you can use either the regular or the "Light" version.

**Note for Windows users:** If you use Cygwin, do not use the OpenSSL library that comes with
Cygwin, which is built with `cygwin.dll` as a dependency. Instead, download a fresh copy from
OpenSSL as described in the following section.

## Step 1. Create keystores

The <%=vars.product_name%> server requires keys and keystores in the Java Key Store (JKS) format while the native client requires them in the clear PEM format. Thus you need to be able to generate private/public keypairs in either format and convert between the two using the `keytool` utility and the `openssl` command.

There are public third party free tools and source code available to download such as the "KeyTool IUI" tool.


## Step 2. Configure environment variables

Configure your system environment to build and run OpenSSL by adding the appropriate executable and library directories to your paths.
For example, for Bourne and Korn shells (sh, ksh, bash), environment setup would look something like this:
<code>
% LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH:_client-install-dir_/lib:_client-install-dir_/ssl\_libs:_openssl-install-dir_/lib<br />
% export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH<br />
% CLASSPATH=_server-install-dir_/lib/securityImpl.jar:$CLASSPATH
</code>

where:

  _client-install-dir_ is the directory in which you installed your client.

  _openssl-install-dir_ is the directory in which you installed OpenSSL.

  _server-install-dir_ is the directory in which you installed your server.

For Windows, environment setup might resemble this:
<code>
\> set PATH=_jdk-or-jre-path_\bin;_client-install-dir_\bin;_client-install-dir_\ssl\_libs;_openssl-install-dir_\bin;%PATH%<br />
\> set CLASSPATH=_server-installdir_\lib\securityImpl.jar;%CLASSPATH%
</code>

where _jdk-or-jre-path_ is the directory in which Java is installed.

## Step 3. Configure SSL properties in client and server properties files

Configure SSL properties. For details on the SSL properties available, see "Managing > Security >
SSL > Configuring SSL" in the server User Guide.  

On the client, the list of enabled components reflects the server’s configuration so the client
knows how it is expected to communicate with (for example) servers and locators. Paths to keystore
and truststore are local to the client.

1.  In your client properties file (usually `gemfire.properties`), set `ssl-enabled-components` to appropriate values (for example, `server,locator`) and set `ssl-keystore` and `ssl-truststore` to point to your keystore files. See [Security-Related System Properties (gemfire.properties)](security-systemprops.html#security) for a description of these properties.
2.  On each locator, enable SSL and set the following SSL properties in the locator’s properties file (usually `gemfire.properties`, but on the locator's host):

    ```
    ssl-enabled-components=server,locator
    ssl-protocols=any
    ssl-ciphers=SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA
    ```
    Make sure your choice of cipher matches a cipher supported on the server.

# Starting and stopping the client and server with SSL in place

Before you start and stop the client and server, make sure you configure the native client with the
SSL properties as described and with the servers or locators specified as usual.

Specifically, ensure that:

-   OpenSSL and ACE\_SSL `DLL`s locations are in the right environment variables for your system: `PATH` for Windows, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for Unix.
-   You have generated the keys and keystores.
-   You have set the system properties.

For details on stopping and starting locators and cache servers with SSL, see [Starting Up and Shutting Down Your System](geodeman/configuring/running/starting_up_shutting_down.html).

**Example locator start command**

Ensure that all required SSL properties are configured in your server's `gemfire.properties` file. Then start your locator as follows:

``` pre
gfsh>start locator --name=my_locator --port=12345 --dir=. \
--security-properties-file=/path/to/your/gemfire.properties
```

**Example locator stop command**

``` pre
gfsh>stop locator --port=12345 \
--security-properties-file=/path/to/your/gemfire.properties
```

**Example server start command**

Again, ensure that all required SSL properties are configured in `gemfire.properties`. Then start the server with:

``` pre
gfsh>start server --name=my_server --locators=hostname[12345] \
--cache-xml-file=server.xml --log-level=fine \
--security-properties-file=/path/to/your/gemfire.properties
```

**Example server stop command**

``` pre
gfsh>stop server --name=my_server
```
