This section describes how to configure OpenSSL, implement SSL-based communication between your clients and servers, and run clients and servers with SSL enabled.

# Set Up OpenSSL

The open-source OpenSSL toolkit provides a full-strength general purpose cryptography library to operate along with the PKCS sample implementation for encrypted authentication of native client credentials.

Follow these instructions to download and install OpenSSL for your specific operating system.

The native client requires OpenSSL 1.0.1t or later. For Windows platforms, you can use either the regular or the OpenSSL 1.0.1t "Light" version.

**Note for Windows users:** If you use Cygwin, do not use the OpenSSL library that comes with
Cygwin, which is built with `cygwin.dll` as a dependency. Instead, download a fresh copy from
OpenSSL as described in the following section.

## Step 1. Download and install OpenSSL

To install OpenSSL:

1. Download the OpenSSL archive from the [OpenSSL web site](http://www.openssl.org/source/). 

2. Extract the archive in a directory of your choice. For example:

    ```
    $ tar xvzf openssl-1.0.1u.tar.gz
    x openssl-1.0.1u/ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
    x openssl-1.0.1u/apps/
    x openssl-1.0.1u/apps/app_rand.c
    ...
    ```

3. Look in the top-level directory of the source distribution to identify the installation instructions for your operating system:

    ```
    $ cd openssl-1.0.1u
    $ ls INSTALL*
    INSTALL        INSTALL.DJGPP      INSTALL.MacOS      INSTALL.NW        INSTALL.OS2
    INSTALL.VMS    INSTALL.W32        INSTALL.W64        INSTALL.WCE
    ```

4. Build the OpenSSL library by following the instructions for your operating system.

## Step 2. Create keystores

The Geode server requires keys and keystores in the Java Key Store (JKS) format while the native client requires them in the clear PEM format. Thus you need to be able to generate private/public keypairs in either format and convert between the two using the `keytool` utility and the `openssl` command.

There are public third party free tools and source code available to download such as the "KeyTool IUI" tool.


## Step 3. Configure environment variables

Configure your system environment to build and run OpenSSL by adding the appropriate executable and library directories to your paths.
For example, for Bourne and Korn shells (sh, ksh, bash), environment setup would look something like this:
<code>
% LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH:_client-install-dir_/lib:_client-install-dir_/ssl\_libs:_openssl-install-dir_/lib<br />
% export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH<br />
% CLASSPATH=_server-install-dir_/lib/securityImpl.jar:$CLASSPATH
</code>

where:

  _client-install-dir_ is the directory in which you installed your client.

  _openssl-install-dir_ is the directory in which you installed OpenSSL.

  _server-install-dir_ is the directory in which you installed your server.

For Windows, environment setup might resemble this:
<code>
\> set PATH=_jdk-or-jre-path_\bin;_client-install-dir_\bin;_client-install-dir_\ssl\_libs;_openssl-install-dir_\bin;%PATH%<br />
\> set CLASSPATH=_server-installdir_\lib\securityImpl.jar;%CLASSPATH%
</code>

where _jdk-or-jre-path_ is the directory in which Java is installed.

## Step 4. Configure SSL properties in client and server properties files

Configure SSL properties.

1.  In your client properties file (usually `geode.properties`), set `ssl-enabled` to true and set `ssl-keystore` and `ssl-truststore` to point to your keystore files. See [Security-Related System Properties (geode.properties)](security-systemprops.html#security) for a description of these properties.
2.  On each locator, enable SSL and set the following SSL properties in the locatorâ€™s properties file (usually `geode.properties`, but on the locator's host):

    ```
    ssl-enabled-components=server,locator
    ssl-protocols=any
    ssl-ciphers=SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA
    ```
    Make sure your choice of cipher matches a cipher supported on the server.

# Starting and stopping the client and server with SSL in place

Before you start and stop the client and server, make sure you configure the native client with the
SSL properties as described and with the servers or locators specified as usual.

Specifically, ensure that:

-   OpenSSL and ACE\_SSL `DLL`s locations are in the right environment variables for your system: `PATH` for Windows, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for Unix.
-   You have generated the keys and keystores.
-   You have set the system properties.

For details on stopping and starting locators and cache servers with SSL, see [Starting Up and Shutting Down Your System](geodeman/configuring/running/starting_up_shutting_down.html).

**Example locator start command**

Ensure that all required SSL properties are configured in your server's `geode.properties` file. Then start your locator as follows:

``` pre
gfsh>start locator --name=my_locator --port=12345 --dir=. \
--security-properties-file=/path/to/your/geode.properties
```

**Example locator stop command**

``` pre
gfsh>stop locator --port=12345 \
--security-properties-file=/path/to/your/geode.properties
```

**Example server start command**

Again, ensure that all required SSL properties are configured in `geode.properties`. Then start the server with:

``` pre
gfsh>start server --name=my_server --locators=hostname[12345] \
--cache-xml-file=server.xml --log-level=fine \
--security-properties-file=/path/to/your/geode.properties
```

**Example server stop command**

``` pre
gfsh>stop server --name=my_server
```
