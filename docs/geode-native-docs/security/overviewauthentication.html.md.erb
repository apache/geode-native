A client is authenticated when it connects, with valid credentials, to a <%=vars.product_name%> cache server that is configured with the client `Authenticator` callback.

Once the client is authenticated, the server assigns the client a unique ID and principal, used to authorize operations. The client must trust all cache servers in the server system as it may connect to any one of them.

-   **[Configuring Credentials for Authentication](systempropsforauth.html)**

    The native client uses system properties to acquire valid credentials for authentication by the server. You define these properties in the `geode.properties` file, which the native client accesses during startup.

-   **[Configuring Authentication by the Cache Server](authforcacheserver.html)**

    When the cache server receives client credentials during the handshake operation, the server authenticates the client with the callback configured in the `security-client-authenticator` system property. The handshake succeeds or fails depending on the results of the authentication process.

-   **[Server Authentication Errors](handling-serv-auth-errors.html)**

-   **[Creating Multiple Secure User Connections](createsecureconnregionservice.html)**

    To create multiple, secure connections to your servers from a single client, so the client can service different user types, you create an authenticated `RegionService` for each user.
