The cache is the entry point to data caching in Geode. Through the cache, clients gain access to the Geode caching framework for data loading, distribution, and maintenance.

-   **[About the Client Cache](overview-client-cache.html)**

    The cache consists of data regions, each of which can contain any number of entries. Region entries hold the cached data. Every entry has a key that uniquely identifies it within the region and a value where the data object is stored.

-   **[Cache APIs](caching-apis.html)**

    The client has two cache APIs, `RegionService` and `Cache`.

-   **[Local, Remote, and Distributed Caches](cache-ownership.html)**

    The *distributed system* defines how client and cache server processes find each other.

-   **[Creating and Accessing a Cache](create-access-cache.html)**

    When you create a client cache, you are creating a client cache instance. You must provide some basic configuration information such as a connection name and cache initialization parameters for the client's cache instance.

-   **[Closing the Cache](closing-cache.html)**

    Use the `Cache::close` function to release system resources when you finish using the cache.
