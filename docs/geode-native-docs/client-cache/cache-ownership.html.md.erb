The *distributed system* defines how client and server processes find each other.

The distributed system keeps track of its membership list and makes its members aware of the identities of the other members in the distributed system.

A cache within the client is referred to as its *local cache*. All other caches in the distributed system are considered *remote caches* to the application. Every cache server and application process has its own cache. The term *distributed cache* is used to describe the union of all caches in the distributed system.
