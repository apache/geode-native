<a id="concurrency-level__section_20FB0B9EEE9442BAAD87E3C488610866"></a>
This attribute estimates the maximum number of application threads that concurrently access a region entry at one time. This attribute helps optimize the use of system resources and reduce thread contention.

The following declaration sets the region's `ConcurrencyLevel` to `16`:

``` pre
<region-attributes concurrency-level="16">
</region-attributes>
```

**Note:**
When `CachingEnabled` is `false`, do not set the `ConcurrencyLevel` attribute. An `IllegalStateException` is thrown if the attribute is set.
