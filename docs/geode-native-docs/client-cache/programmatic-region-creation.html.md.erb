You create regions programmatically with the `regionFactory` class.

**Note:**
Before creating a region, specify region attributes. See [Region Attributes](region-attributes.html).

Create your regions using the `regionFactory` class.

**C++ RegionFactory Example**

``` pre
RegionFactoryPtr regionFactory =
    cachePtr->createRegionFactory(CACHING_PROXY);
RegionPtr regPtr0 = regionFactory->setLruEntriesLimit(20000)
        ->create("exampleRegion0");
    
```
