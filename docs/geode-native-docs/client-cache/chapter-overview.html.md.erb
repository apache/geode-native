This section describes the client cache functionality, initialization file, and APIs. It provides information about creating and working with caches, cache regions, and region entries.

The client cache provides a framework for clients to store, manage, and distribute application data.

-   **[Caches](caches.html)**

    The cache is the entry point to data caching in Geode. Through the cache, clients gain access to the Geode caching framework for data loading, distribution, and maintenance.

-   **[Cache Initialization File (cache.xml)](../cache-init-file/chapter-overview.html)**

    To ease the task of managing the structure of the cache, you can define the default Geode cache structure in an XML-based initialization file.

-   **[Regions](regions.html)**

    You create cache regions either programmatically or through declarative statements in the `cache.xml` file. Generally, a cache is organized and populated through a combination of the two approaches.

-   **[Region Entries](entries.html)**

    Region entries hold cached application data. Entries are automatically managed according to region attribute settings.

-   **[Region Consistency](consistency_checking_in_regions.html)**

    Geode ensures that all copies of a region eventually reach a consistent state on all members and clients that host the region.

-   **[Region Attributes](region-attributes.html)**

    Region attributes govern the automated management of a region and its entries.

-   **[Cache Management](cache-management.html)**

    This section covers cache management.
