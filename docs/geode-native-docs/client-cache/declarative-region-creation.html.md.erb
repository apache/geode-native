Declarative region creation involves placing the region's XML declaration, with the appropriate attribute settings, in the `cache.xml` file that is loaded at cache creation.

**Note:**
Before creating a region, specify region attributes. See [Region Attributes](region-attributes.html).

Regions are placed inside the cache declaration in `region` elements. For example:

``` pre
<cache>
  <pool name="examplePool" subscription-enabled="true" >
    <server host="localhost" port="40404" />
  </pool>
  <region name="A" refid="PROXY">
    <region-attributes pool-name="examplePool"/>
  </region>
  <region name="A1">
    <region-attributes refid="PROXY" pool-name="examplePool"/>
  </region>
  <region name="A2" refid="CACHING_PROXY">
    <region-attributes pool-name="examplePool">
      <region-time-to-live>
        <expiration-attributes timeout="120" action="invalidate"/>
      </region-time-to-live>
    </region-attributes>
  </region>
</cache>
    
```

The `cache.xml` file contents must conform to the XML described at [http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache/cache-1.0.xsd](http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache/cache-1.0.xsd). For details, see [Cache Initialization File](../cache-init-file/chapter-overview.html).
