This attribute determines whether data is cached in this region. For example, you might choose to configure the distributed system as a simple messaging service where clients run without a cache.

**Note:**
You can configure the most common of these options with the predefined region attributes. See [Region Shortcuts](region-shortcuts.html#region-shortcuts) and the Javadocs for `RegionShortcut`.

If `CachingEnabled` is false (no caching), an `IllegalStateException` is thrown if any of these attributes are set:

-   [InitialCapacity](initial-capacity.html#initial-capacity)
-   `EntryTimeToLive` under [Specifying Expiration Attributes](expiration-attributes.html#expiration-attributes)
-   `EntryIdleTimeout` under [Specifying Expiration Attributes](expiration-attributes.html#expiration-attributes)
-   [LoadFactor](load-factor.html#load-factor)
-   [ConcurrencyLevel](concurrency-level.html#concurrency-level)
-   [LruEntriesLimit](lru-entries-limit.html#concept_75D723D60E044FF9AE97C939699AB10A)
-   [DiskPolicy](disk-policy.html#disk-policy)

The following declaration enables caching for the region:

``` pre
<region-attributes caching-enabled="true"> 
</region-attributes>
```
