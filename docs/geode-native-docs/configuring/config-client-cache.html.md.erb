The client cache provides a framework for clients to store, manage, and distribute application data.

The cache is the entry point for access to <%=vars.product_name%>. Through the cache, clients gain
access to the <%=vars.product_name%> caching framework for data loading, distribution, and
maintenance.

The `Cache` instance allows your client to set general parameters for communication between a cache
and other caches in the distributed system, and to create and access any region in the cache.

Regions are created from the `Cache` instance. Regions provide the entry point to the interfaces for
instances of `Region` and `RegionEntry`.

For more information specific to your client programming language, see the
[C++ Client API](../cpp-caching-api/cpp-caching-api.html) or the
[.NET Client API](../dotnet-caching-api/dotnet-caching-api.html).

The `Cache` inherits `RegionService` and adds management of these client caching features:

-   Region creation
-   Subscription keepalive management for durable clients
-   Access to the underlying distributed system
-   `RegionService` creation for secure access by multiple users (see [Creating Multiple Secure User Connections with RegionService](../security/createsecureconnregionservice.html).
