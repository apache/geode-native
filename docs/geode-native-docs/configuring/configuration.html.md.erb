You configure your native client to establish connectivity to a server, which requires specifying

  - Locator address and port
  - Connection credentials
  - Identity of a shared region on the server

You can configure your native client application:

 - Programmatically in your app code
 - Via XML files and properties files
 - Through a combination of programmatic and file-based approaches

This section describes configuration on two levels, the system level and the cache level.

## <a id="config_programmatic_vs_xml"></a>Programmatic Configuration vs XML Configuration

**C++ RegionFactory Example**

The following examples illustrate how to set a region's expiration timeout attribute programmatically and through XML.

Setting a property programmatically:

``` cpp
    auto regionFactory = cache.createRegionFactory(RegionShortcut::CACHING_PROXY);
    auto region = regionFactory.setRegionTimeToLive(ExpirationAction::INVALIDATE, 120)
         .create("exampleRegion0");
```

XML equivalent:

``` xml
  <region name="exampleRegion0" refid="CACHING_PROXY">
    <region-attributes pool-name="default">
      <region-time-to-live>
        <expiration-attributes timeout="120" action="invalidate"/>
      </region-time-to-live>
    </region-attributes>
  </region>
```

## <a id="config_connecting_to_the_server"></a>Connecting to the Server

Example of connecting to the Server, taken from the put-get-remove example.

``` cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {

  auto cacheFactory = CacheFactory();                         // instantiate cache factory
  cacheFactory.set("log-level", "none");                      // set cache log-level characteristics
  auto cache = cacheFactory.create();                         // create cache
  auto poolFactory = cache.getPoolManager().createFactory();  // instantiate pool factory

  poolFactory.addLocator("localhost", 10334);                 // add locator to pool factory
  auto pool = poolFactory.create("pool");                     // create a pool called "pool" that knows where the server is
  auto regionFactory = cache.createRegionFactory(RegionShortcut::PROXY); // instantiate region factory with PROXY characteristics
  auto region = regionFactory.setPoolName("pool").create("example_userinfo"); // create a connection to the region "example_userinfo" on the server

  ...            // do something

  cache.close(); // clean up
}
```

## Tables of properties

See [System Properties](sysprops.html) for a list of system properties that can be configured
programmatically or in the `geode.properties` file.

## <a id="config_high_availability"></a>High Availability with Server Redundancy

When redundancy is enabled, secondary servers maintain queue backups while the primary server pushes
events to the client. If the primary server fails, one of the secondary servers steps in as primary
to provide uninterrupted event messaging to the client. 
See the _<%=vars.product_name%> User Guide_ section [Configuring Highly Available Servers](/serverman/developing/events/configuring_highly_available_servers.html)
for details on configuring your system for high availability with server redundancy.
