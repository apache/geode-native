An example shows how to connect to <%=vars.product_name%>, create a cache and region, put and get keys and values, and disconnect.

## Simple C\# Code

``` pre
class BasicOperations
{
   public static void Main(string[] args)
   {
      try
      {
         // 1. Create a cache
         CacheFactory cacheFactory = CacheFactory.CreateCacheFactory();
         Cache cache = cacheFactory.Create();

         // 2. Create default region attributes using region factory
         RegionFactory regionFactory =
            cache.CreateRegionFactory(RegionShortcut.CACHING_PROXY);

         // 3. Create a region
         IRegion<int, string> region =
            regionFactory.Create<int, string>("exampleRegion");

         // 4. Put some entries
         region[111] = "Value1";
         region[123] = "123";

         // 5. Get the entries
         string result1 = region[111];
         string result2 = region[123];

         // 6. Close cache
         cache.Close();
      }
   }
}
```
