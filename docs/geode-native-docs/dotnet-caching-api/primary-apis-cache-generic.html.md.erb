These are the main APIs within `Apache.Geode.Client` used for cache, region, and data entry management.

**Note:**
Declarative configuration via XML of application plug-ins such as cache listener, cache writer, cache loader and partition resolver is not supported when clients are operated in the new .NET Generic API.

-   **[Cache APIs](cache-apis.html)**

    This section describes the `CacheFactory` and `Cache` classes.

-   **[Region and Entry APIs](region-entry-apis.html)**

    This section describes classes for working with regions and region entries.

-   **[Data Serialization APIs](data-serialization-apis.html)**

    Use either `IPdxSerializable` or `IGeodeSerializable` for each region. Do not mix the two.

-   **[Event Handling APIs](event-handling-apis.html)**

    Code your event handlers to do minimal work before returning control to Geode.

-   **[Property Collections and Logging APIs](other-apis.html)**
