You can use the `IPdxInstanceFactory` to create an `IPdxInstance` from raw data when the domain class is not available on the server.

This option can be useful when you need an instance of a domain class for plug-in code such as a function or a loader. If you have the raw data for the domain object (the class name and each field's type and data), then you can explicitly create a `IPdxInstance`. The `IPdxInstanceFactory` is very similar to the `IPdxWriter` except that after writing each field, you need to call the create method which returns the created `IPdxInstance.`

View the PdxInstance QuickStart for an example.
