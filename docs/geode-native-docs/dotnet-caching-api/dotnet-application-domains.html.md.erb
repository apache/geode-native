Application domains, or `AppDomain`s, are units of isolation, security boundaries, and do the loading and unloading for applications in the .NET runtime. Multiple application domains can run in a single process. Each can have one or many threads, and a thread can switch application domains at runtime.

The .NET managed assemblies require interface methods invoked by the C++ layer to be in the same `AppDomain` as that of the .NET DLL. If not, an exception is thrown because the thread is unable to cross `AppDomain` boundaries.
