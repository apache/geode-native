This section describes how transactions work on the client side. It provides examples for running, suspending, and resuming transactions.

Client transactions run on the server tier. The client uses a server delegate
that runs the transaction as it would a local transaction.
Thus, the key to running client transactions lies in making sure the server
is properly configured and programmed.
For complete information about transactions in the Java server,
see the server documentation at
[Transactions](geodeman/developing/transactions/chapter_overview.html).
It provides detailed information including server data requirements,
interactions of transactions with other operations running on the server tier,
server-side application plug-ins with transactions,
and querying with transactions.

-   **[How Client Transactions Work](how-native-client-xacts-work.html)**

    The syntax for writing client transactions is the same as with server or peer transactions, but when a client performs a transaction, the transaction is delegated to a server that brokers the transaction.

-   **[Running a Client Transaction](running-native-client-xact.html)**

    Before you can run a client transaction, you must configure your clients and servers; define your server regions for your transactions; and define your client regions.

-   **[Suspending and Resuming Transactions](suspend-resume-xacts.html)**

    The ability to suspend and resume transactions is useful when a thread must perform operations that should not be part of the transaction before the transaction can complete.
