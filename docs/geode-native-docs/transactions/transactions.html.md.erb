Client transactions run on the server tier. The client uses a server delegate
that runs the transaction as it would a local transaction.
Thus, the key to running client transactions lies in making sure the server
is properly configured and programmed.
For complete information about transactions in the <%=vars.product_name%> server,
see the server documentation at
[Transactions](geodeman/developing/transactions/chapter_overview.html).
It provides detailed information including server data requirements,
interactions of transactions with other operations running on the server tier,
server-side application plug-ins with transactions,
and querying with transactions.
