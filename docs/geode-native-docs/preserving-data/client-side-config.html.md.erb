All durable messaging configurations are performed on the client.

-   **[Configuring a Durable Client](configuring-durable-nc.html)**

    The durable client can be configured in the `gfcpp.properties` file, or in the `CacheFactory::set(name,             value)` call.

-   **[Configuring Durable Interest in Keys](config-durable-interest-keys.html)**

    When a durable client disconnects, its servers keep queuing messages for selected keys. The client indicates which keys by registering durable interest for those keys.

-   **[Configuring Durable Client Reconnection](config-durable-reconnect.html)**

    You can configure the durable client to obtain an approximate count of pending events upon durable client reconnection. Based on the returned number, you can determine whether to proceed and receive the pending events or to close the cache.
