An example `cache.xml` file shows cache and region initialization for a client, presenting a subset of the possible data configurations.

For detailed information about cache and region configuration, including the default attribute settings, see [The Native Client Cache](../client-cache/chapter-overview.html#native-client-cache). Also see the online API documentation for `Cache` and `RegionAttributes`.

For information a cache with server pool, see [Using Connection Pools](../connection-pools/connection-pools.html#using-connection-pools). The example below shows a `cache.xml` file that creates two regions.

-   Region `region1` is defined with a full set of region attributes and application plug-ins. The region's entries have `RegionTimeToLive` and `RegionIdleTimeout` expiration attributes set ([Expiration Attributes](../client-cache/expiration-attributes.html#expiration-attributes)).
-   Region `region2` uses mostly default values.
