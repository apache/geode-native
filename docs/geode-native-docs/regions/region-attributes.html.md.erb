Region attributes govern the automated management of a region and its entries.

Region attribute settings determine where the data resides, how the region is managed in memory, and the automatic loading, distribution, and expiration of region entries.

## <a id="specifying-region-attributes" class="no-quick-link"></a>Specifying Region Attributes

Specify region attributes before creating the region. You can do this either through the API or
through the declarative XML file. The API includes classes for defining a region's attributes before
creation and for modifying some attributes after creation. For details, see the API for
`RegionShortcut`, `RegionAttributes`, `RegionAttributesFactory`, and `AttributesMutator`.

## <a id="region-shortcuts" class="no-quick-link"></a>Region Shortcuts

<%=vars.product_name%> provides predefined, shortcut region attributes settings for your use in `RegionShortcut`.
The shortcuts are:

`PROXY`
>  does not store data in the client cache, but connects the region to the servers.

`CACHING_PROXY`
>  stores data in the client cache and connects the region to the servers.

`CACHING_PROXY_ENTRY_LRU`
>  stores data in the client cache and connects the region to the servers.
Limits the amount of data stored locally in the client to a default limit of 100,000 entries by ejecting the least recently used (LRU) entries.

`LOCAL`
>  stores data in the client cache and does not connect the region to the servers. This is a client-side-only region.

`LOCAL_ENTRY_LRU`
>  stores data in the client cache and does not connect the region to the servers. This is a client-side-only region.
Limits the amount of data stored locally in the client to a default limit of 100,000 entries by ejecting the least recently used (LRU) entries.
