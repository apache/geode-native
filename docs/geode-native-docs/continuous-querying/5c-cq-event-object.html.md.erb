The `CqEvent` object contains information about the CQ event.

-   Entry key and new value.
-   Base operation that triggered the CQ event in the server.
-   `CqQuery` object associated with this CQ event.
-   Query operation associated with this CQ event. This operation describes the change affected to the query results by the cache event. Possible values are:
    -   `CREATE`, which corresponds to the standard database `INSERT` operation.
    -   ` UPDATE`
    -   `DESTROY`, which corresponds to the standard database `DELETE` operation.

This table describes the query operation based on whether the old and new entry values in the region entry event satisfy the query criteria.

You can use the query operation to decide what to do with the `CqEvent` in your listeners. For example, a `CqListener` that displays query results on screen might stop displaying the entry, start displaying the entry, or update the entry display depending on the query operation.
