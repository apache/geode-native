This example shows how to declare a client region in a `cache.xml` file.

``` pre
<cache>
  <region name = "root1" >
    <region-attributes refid="CACHING_PROXY" pool-name="poolName1"/>
  </region>
  <region name = "root2" >
    <region-attributes refid="PROXY" pool-name="poolName2"/>
  </region>
  <pool name="poolName1" subscription-enabled="true">
    <server host="localhost" port="40404" />
  </pool>
  <pool name="poolName2" subscription-enabled="true">
    <server host="localhost" port="40404" />
  </pool>
</cache>
```

-   The pool defines a list of cache servers that the client region can communicate with.
-   The *CACHING\_PROXY* setting causes the client region to cache data and to communicate with the servers. The *PROXY* setting causes the client region to communicate with the servers, but cache no data.
-   The region *subscription-enabled* property, if `true` , indicates that the client should receive data updates when server data changes.
-   Clients do not specify cache loaders or writers, which are provided by the server.
