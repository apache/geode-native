This section describes how to build and run a native client application on Solaris.

## <a id="developing-solaris__section_B518757C7D7A405F9E43C1232C2D6B56" class="no-quick-link"></a>Step 1. Set Environment Variables

**Note:** When compiling external projects or applications that are used or referenced by the native client, make sure that you compile them for the same target architecture as your native client installation. For example, if you installed the 32-bit (x86) version of the native client, compile your external projects for 32-bit (x86) architecture.

Set the native client environment variables on each Solaris host. For each case, *product-dir* is the path to the native client product directory.

**For Bourne and Korn shells (sh, ksh, bash)**

<code>
GFCPP=_product-dir_; export GFCPP<br />
PATH=$GFCPP/bin:$PATH;export PATH<br />
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=$GFCPP/lib:$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH;export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
</code>

Version 5.9 of the *SUNpro* compiler is supported on Solaris. The linker switches vary according to whether you are statically linking to the native client library.

To build and link a C++ client on Solaris, the compilation command line must include the appropriate arguments from this table.

| `-xarch=v8plus`                                                                                | Enables 32-bit compilation.                                |

| `-ldl`; `-lpthread`; `-lc`; `-lm`; `-lsocket`; `-lrt`; `-lnsl`; `-ldemangle`; `-lkstat`; `-lz` | Additional libraries.                                      |

| `-I$ GFCPP /include`                                                                           | Specifies the GemFire include directory.                   |

When a C++ application is not statically linked to the native client library, the library must be dynamically loadable.

To verify that the native client library is available for loading, make sure you have added the path *product-dir*`/lib` to the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable, where *product-dir* is the path to the Geode product directory.
