The Apache Geode client provides access for C++ and Microsoft® .NET™ clients to the Geode distributed system. 
As an open source project, the client (at least theoretically) can be built on nearly any system.
In practical terms, the client is known to have been successfully built and used on platforms running Microsoft Windows, Linux (Intel), and Sun Solaris.

For your convenience, this table shows configuration guidelines for some familiar operating systems.

## Host Machine Configuration Guidelines

Each machine that runs a Geode client should meet the following guidelines:

-   A system clock set to the correct time and a time synchronization
service such as Network Time Protocol (NTP).
Correct time stamps permit the following activities:
    - Logs that are useful for troubleshooting. Synchronized time stamps ensure that log messages from different hosts can be merged to reproduce an accurate chronological history of a distributed run.
    - Aggregate product-level and application-level time statistics.
    - Accurate monitoring of the system with scripts and other tools that read the system statistics and log files.
-   The host name and host files are properly configured for the machine.
-   Many default Linux installations use SYN cookies to protect the
system against malicious attacks that flood TCP SYN packets.
The use of SYN cookies dramatically reduces network bandwidth,
and can be triggered by a running GemFire distributed system.

    To disable SYN cookies permanently:
    1. Edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file to include the following line:

        ``` pre
        net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 0
        ```
        Setting this value to zero disables SYN cookies.
    2. Reload `sysctl.conf`:

        ``` pre
        sysctl -p
        ```

**Runtime Library**

The Geode client requires the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784). 
This package contains runtime libraries needed by the client; install it for your platform architecture on all machines that will run the client.

**.NET Framework Version Support**

The Geode client is supported with Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2.

A Microsoft .NET Framework must be installed to support the C++/CLI (Common Language Infrastructure) library for the client.

The Geode supports .NET 4.5.2 and Visual Studio 2013 (for compiling C++ applications on Windows). 
For more information on the features of .NET and Visual Studio Community Edition 2013 Update 5, see the [Visual Studio 2013 web page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd831853(v=vs.120).aspx).

For Linux, you can verify that you meet the client dependencies at the library level by using the `ldd` tool and entering this command:

``` pre
prompt> ldd $client-installdir/lib/libgfcppcache.so
```
where _client-installdir_ is the location in which you have installed the Geode client.

The following libraries are external dependencies of the client library, `libgfcppcache.so`. Verify that the ldd tool output includes all of these:

-   libdl.so.2
-   libm.so.6
-   libpthread.so.0
-   libc.so.6
-   libz.so.1


## <a id="concept_7AE0C1CB11244095A50CCB52A09A09A1__ssl_requirements" class="no-quick-link"></a>Software Requirements for Using SSL

If you plan on using SSL in your Geode client and server deployment, you will need to download and install OpenSSL.

The client requires OpenSSL 1.0.1t or later. For Windows platforms, you can use either the regular or the OpenSSL "Light" version.

In addition, make sure that your system environment variables have been configured to include OpenSSL.

See [SSL Client/Server Communication](../security/sslclientserver.html) for instructions.
