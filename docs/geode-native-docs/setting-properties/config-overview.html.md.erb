You can configure clients through files and API calls. The servers are configured through command-line input and configuration files.

-   **[Client Configuration](client-config.html)**

    You configure the client in two files: `geode.properties` for system-level configuration and `cache.xml` for cache-level configuration.

-   **[Cache Server Configuration](cache-server-config.html)**

    You configure the cache server in two files: `gemfire.properties` for server system-level configuration and `cache.xml` for cache-level configuration.

-   **[Attribute Definition Priority](attribute-def-priority.html)**

    You can specify attributes in different ways, which can cause conflicting definitions. Applications can be configured programmatically, and that has priority over other settings.

-   **[Search Path for Multiple Properties Files](propfile-search-path.html)**

    The client and server processes first look for their properties file in the <code>_product-dir_/defaultSystem</code> directory, then in the working directory.

-   **[Overriding Properties File Settings](propfile-overriding.html)**

    Application developers have the option of configuring system attributes programmatically, rather than using the `geode.properties` file.

-   **[Defining Properties Programmatically](define-programmatically.html)**

    You can pass in specific properties programmatically by using a `Properties` object to define the non-default properties.
