title:  Configuring the Native Client and Cache Server
---

You can configure clients through files and API calls. The servers are configured through command-line input and configuration files.

-   **[Native Client Configuration](native-client-config.html)**

    You configure the native client in two files: `gfcpp.properties` for native client system-level configuration and `cache.xml` for cache-level configuration.

-   **[Cache Server Configuration](cache-server-config.html)**

    You configure the cache server in two files: `gemfire.properties` for server system-level configuration and `cache.xml` for cache-level configuration.

-   **[Attribute Definition Priority](attribute-def-priority.html)**

    You can specify attributes in different ways, which can cause conflicting definitions. Applications can be configured programmatically, and that has priority over other settings.

-   **[Search Path for Multiple gfcpp.properties Files](../gfcpp.properties/gfcpp.properties_search_path.html)**

    The native client and cache server processes first look for their properties file in the <code>_product-dir_/defaultSystem</code> directory, then in the working directory.

-   **[Overriding gfcpp.properties Settings](../gfcpp.properties/overriding_gfcpp.properties.html)**

    Application developers have the option of configuring system attributes programmatically, rather than using the `gfcpp.properties` file.

-   **[Defining Properties Programmatically](define-programmatically.html)**

    You can pass in specific gfcpp properties programmatically by using a `Properties` object to define the non-default properties.
