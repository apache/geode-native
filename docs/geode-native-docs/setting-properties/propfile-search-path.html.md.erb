The client and cache server processes first look for their properties file in the <code>_product-dir_/defaultSystem</code> directory, then in the working directory.

Any properties set in the working directory override settings in the `defaultSystem/geode.properties` file.

If you are running multiple processes on one machine, you can configure the `geode.properties` file in the `defaultSystem` directory as a shared file that all processes can find. If a few processes need a slightly different configuration, you can put individual `geode.properties` files in their home directories to override specific properties.
