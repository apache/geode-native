A variety of `geode.properties` settings can be used when a client connects to a distributed system.

The following settings can be configured:

-   **[General Properties](#attributes-gfcpp__table_21004C9E93294F03BE3469C13EA33262)** Basic information for the process, such as cache creation parameters.
-   **[Logging Properties](#attributes-gfcpp__table_D42627049FD6432494BDE5170AF1BCCF)** How and where to log system messages.
-   **[Statistics Archiving Properties](#attributes-gfcpp__table_E1A0EDBA67CD41319E1E5FD0A0BB2723)** How to collect and archive statistics information.
-   **[Durable Client Properties](#attributes-gfcpp__table_BA6DAF27947B4A9488787E6BDCFC15B9)** Information about the durable clients connected to the system.
-   **[Security Properties](#attributes-gfcpp__table_B3A8E9EB44A94557A97BB700E2BA1EF1)** Information about various security parameters.

## <a id="attributes-gfcpp__section_655789BCC46642789F91CDA8AE03CD9B" class="no-quick-link"></a>Attribute Definitions

The following tables list attributes that can be stored in the `geode.properties` file to be read by a client.

For the system properties that relate to high availability, see [Sending Periodic Acknowledgement](../preserving-data/sending-periodic-ack.html#concept_868B8082463846DE9F35BBEA56105C82). For a list of security-related system properties and their descriptions, see the table [System Properties for Client Authentication and Authorization](../security/security-systemprops.html#security__table_92A6A66523764199A19BCD66BA189921).
