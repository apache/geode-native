You configure the cache server in two files: `gemfire.properties` for server system-level configuration and `cache.xml` for cache-level configuration.

The configuration of the caches is part of the application development process. See [Cache Initialization File (cache.xml)](../cache-init-file/chapter-overview.html#chapter-overview). The cache-level configuration file is generally referred to as `cache.xml`, but you can use any name.

For the cache server, the `gemfire.properties` file is usually stored in the current working directory.

For the `cache.xml` configuration file, a client looks for the path specified by the `cache-xml-file` attribute in `geode.properties` (see [Attributes in the Properties File](propfile-attributes.html#attributes-gfcpp)). If the `cache.xml` is not found, the process starts with an unconfigured cache.

In addition to the `gemfire.properties file`, you can pass attributes to the cache server on the gfsh command line. These override any settings found in the `gemfire.properties` file when starting the cache server.
