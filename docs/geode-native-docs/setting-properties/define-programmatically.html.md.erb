You can pass in specific properties programmatically by using a `Properties` object to define the non-default properties.

Example:

``` pre
PropertiesPtr systemProps = Properties::create();
systemProps->insert( "statistic-archive-file", "stats.gfs" );
systemProps->insert( "cache-xml-file", "./myapp-cache.xml" );
systemProps->insert( "stacktrace-enabled", "true" );
CacheFactoryPtr systemPtr = CacheFactory::createCacheFactory(systemProps);
    
```
