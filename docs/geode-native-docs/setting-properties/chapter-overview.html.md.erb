This section describes how to configure clients and cache servers to participate in a distributed system.

-   **[Configuring the Client and Server](config-overview.html)**

    You can configure clients through files and API calls. The servers are configured through command-line input and configuration files.

-   **[Attributes in the Properties File](propfile-attributes.html)**

    A variety of `geode.properties` settings can be used when a client connects to a distributed system.

-   **[Properties File Example](propfile-overview.html)**

    Use the geode.properties file to configure distributed system connections for the client.
