The `FROM` clause establishes collections of objects that are iterated over by the remainder of the query.

The attributes of the objects in these collections are added to the name space scope for the remainder of the `FROM` clause as well as for the `WHERE` clause and the `SELECT` projection list.

Each `FROM` clause expression must evaluate to a collection. The expression `/portfolios.keySet` is valid because it evaluates to a `Collection`, but `/portfolios.name`, which evaluates to a `String` , causes an exception to be thrown.

Like the SQL query, which iterates over the tables named in its `FROM` clause, the `OQL` query iterates over the `Collections` established in its `FROM` clause.

In the following query, `positions.values` evaluates to a `Collection` because `positions` is a Map, and the method values on `Map` returns a `Collection`.

``` pre
IMPORT javaobject.Position;
SELECT DISTINCT "type"
FROM /portfolios, positions.values posnVal TYPE Position
WHERE posnVal.qty > 1000.00
```

Every expression in the `FROM` clause must evaluate to a `Collection`. For a Map, the values method returns a `Collection`.

If positions were a List instead of a Map , this query could be used to retrieve the data:

``` pre
IMPORT javaobject.Position;
SELECT DISTINCT "type"
FROM /portfolios, positions posnVal TYPE Position
WHERE posnVal.qty >= 1000.00
```

A List is a `Collection`, so you can access it directly or through its `toArray` method.

For each object type accessed in your `FROM` clause, use the method that returns a `Collection` for that object.

Each expression in the `FROM` clause can be any expression that evaluates to a `Collection`. An expression in the `FROM` clause is typically a path expression that resolves to a region in the cache so that the values in the region become the collection of objects to filter.

For example, this is a simple `SELECT` statement that evaluates to a set of all the entry value objects of the region `/portfolios` with active status. The collection of entry values provided by the `FROM` clause is traversed by the `WHERE` clause, which accesses each elementâ€™s status attribute for comparison.

``` pre
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM /portfolios WHERE status = 'active'
```

If the `FROM` clause has only one expression in it, the result of the clause is the single collection that the expression evaluates to. If the clause has more than one expression in it, the result is a collection of structs that contain a member for each of those collection expressions. For example, if the `FROM` clause contains three expressions that evaluate to collections `C1`, `C2,` and `C3`, the `FROM` clause generates a set of `struct(x1, x2, x3)` where `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` represent nested iterations over the collections specified.

If the collections are independent of each other, this `struct` represents their cartesian product.

In this query, the `FROM` clause produces a `struct` of `portfolio` and position pairs to be iterated. Each element in the struct contains the portfolio and one of its contained positions.

``` pre
IMPORT javaobject.Position;
SELECT DISTINCT "type" FROM /portfolios, positions TYPE Position
WHERE qty > 1000.00
```
