To use a query string in a client, specify the string as a parameter in a `QueryService::newQuery` method, then execute the query using `Query::execute`, passing in the required parameters.

Alternatively, if an expression evaluates to a boolean value, you can specify it using the region shortcut methods `Region::existsValue`, `Region::selectValue`, and `Region::query`. These shortcut methods evaluate whether given expressions return any entries and return a single value entry, respectively. See [Region Shortcut Query Methods](../95-remotequeryapi/2-create-manage-queries.html#running-native-client-xact__section_0F92AD1BDB29426BB24CD41F5A0FAB78) for more information about these shortcut methods.

If your query requires any `IMPORT` statements, you must include these before the `SELECT` statement in the query string that is passed to the query engine. It should be a fully qualified package name relative to the cache server. The Java class definition must exist and have the same signature as the client C++ class.
