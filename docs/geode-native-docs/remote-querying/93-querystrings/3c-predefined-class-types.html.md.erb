The `FROM` clause establishes collections of objects that are iterated over by the remainder of the query. The attributes of the objects in these collections are added to the name space scope for the remainder of the `FROM` clause as well as for the `WHERE` clause and the `SELECT` projection list.

The type specification can be an imported type or any of these predefined types.
