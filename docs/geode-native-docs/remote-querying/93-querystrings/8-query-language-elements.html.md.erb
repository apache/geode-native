This section discusses various aspects and tools of the native client query engine.

-   **[Method Invocation](8a-method-invocation.html)**

    The query language supports method invocation inside query expressions.

-   **[Supported Query Language Literals](8b-query-lang-literals.html)**

    Query language expressions can contain literals as well as operators and attribute names. The client supports many types of literals.

-   **[Type Conversions](8c-type-conversions.html)**

    Java rules within a query string require the query processor to perform implicit conversions and promotions under certain cases in order to evaluate expressions that contain different types.
