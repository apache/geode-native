To modify the cache based on information retrieved through querying, retrieve the entry keys and use them in the standard entry update methods.

The query service is a data access tool, so it does not provide any cache update functionality.

The next example shows entry key retrieval.

## Get distinct entry keys and positions from active portfolios with at least a $25.00 market value

In the following example, retrieving the entry keys allows you to access the cached region entries for update. You cannot update the cache through the query engine.

``` pre
Query string: 
SELECT DISTINCT key, posnVal
FROM /portfolios.entrySet, value.positions.values posnVal TYPE Position
WHERE posnVal.mktValue >= 25.00

Results: 
A SelectResults of Struct instances containing key, Position pairs.
```
