You use the querying API to access all the querying functionality discussed in the previous sections.

This section gives a general overview of the interfaces and classes that are provided by the Query package API, and the shortcut methods provided in the Region interface.

-   **[Creating and Managing Queries](2-create-manage-queries.html)**

    You create queries on the cache server by obtaining a `QueryService` method and manage them through the resulting `Query` object. The `Region` interface has several shortcut query methods.

-   **[Query Result Sets](3-query-result-sets.html)**

-   **[Query Code Samples Returning ResultSet](../96-progexamples/2-query-code-examples-resultset.html)**

    API examples demonstrate methods for returning `ResultSet` for both built-in and user-fined data types.

-   **[Query Code Samples Returning StructSet](../96-progexamples/3-query-code-examples-structset.html)**

    These examples return a `StructSet` for built-in and user-defined data types, `Struct` objects, and collections.
