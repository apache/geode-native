-   **SelectResults**. Executes the query on the cache server and returns the results as either a `ResultSet` or a StructSet.
-   **SelectResultsIterator**. Iterates over the items available in a `ResultSet` or `StructSet`.
-   **ResultSet**. Obtained after executing a `Query`, which is obtained from a `QueryService` that is obtained from a Cache class.
-   **StructSet**. Used when a `SELECT` statement returns more than one set of results. This is accompanied by a `Struct`, which provides the `StructSet` definition and contains its field values.
