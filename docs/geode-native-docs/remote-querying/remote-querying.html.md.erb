This section documents remote querying from the client to the server. Using examples and procedures, it describes how to use the APIs to run queries against cached data, work with query strings in the client, create and manage queries, and create indexes.

-   **[Remote Querying Basics](91-quickintro/1-quickintro-overview.html)**

    Use the client query API to query your cached data stored on a cache server. The query is evaluated and executed on the cache server, and the results are returned to the client.

-   **[Using Query Strings in the Client](93-querystrings/1-querystring-overview.html)**

    To use a query string in a client, specify the string as a parameter in a `QueryService::newQuery` method, then execute the query using `Query::execute`, passing in the required parameters.

-   **[Accessing Cached Data](92-querylanguage/2-accessingdata.html)**

    Accessing your cached data through the querying service is similar to accessing database contents through SQL queries. How you specify your regions and region contents is particular to the client.

-   **[Query Language Elements](93-querystrings/8-query-language-elements.html)**

    This section discusses various aspects and tools of the client query engine.

-   **[Remote Query API](95-remotequeryapi/1-remote-query-api-overview.html)**

    You use the client querying API to access all the querying functionality discussed in the previous sections.
