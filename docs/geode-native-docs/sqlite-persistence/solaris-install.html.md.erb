This topic describes how to install the SQLite Persistence Manager on Solaris.

The *`product-dir`* directory refers to the path to the directory
that contains the built library.

The following libraries must be present in the runtime linking path:

-   `libSqLiteImpl.so` is provided in <code><i>product-dir</i>/lib</code>, so it is already present in the runtime linking path.
-   `libsqlite3.so` is the SQLite Library. You need to create this library and make available in the runtime linking path, or copied to <code><i>product-dir</i>/lib</code>, as described below.

The library has been tested with SQLite v3.7.14.1.

Create the SQLite database library by downloading the latest .zip file and compiling the source code.

1.  Download the source code `sqlite-autoconf-NNNNNNN.tar.gz` file (where *NNNNNNN* corresponds to the version) for SQLite v3.7.14.1 or later from [http://www.sqlite.org/download.html](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
2.  Update your PATH environment variable to include the location of the Solaris `ar` command.

    ``` pre
    export PATH=/usr/css/bin:$PATH
    ```

3.  Extract the source code from the .tar.gz file. First unzip:

    ``` pre
    gzip -d sqlite-autoconf-3071401.tar.gz
    ```

    Then untar the file:

    ``` pre
    tar -xvf sqlite-autoconf-3071401.tar
    ```

4.  Change directories to the extracted source files, and follow the install instructions located in the "INSTALL" file.
    1.  Run the `configure` command for 32-bit or 64-bit Solaris systems with the following options, all entered on a single command line. Change the` --prefix` directory specification to the location where you want the libraries:
        -   **32-bit:**

            <code>
            CC=cc CFLAGS="-xarch=v8plus -code=pic32" ./configure --prefix=/_desired-binary-location_/sqlite-binaries
            </code>
        -   **64-bit:**

            <code>
            CC=cc CFLAGS="-xarch=v9 -code=pic32" ./configure --prefix=/_desired-binary-location_/sqlite-binaries CFLAGS="-m64"
            </code>

    2.  Run `gmake install`. The libraries will be available in the `sqlite-binaries` directory specified.

5.  Copy <code>/_desired-binary-location_/sqlite-binaries/lib/libsqlite3.so</code> file to <code><i>product-dir</i>/lib</code>.
