Delta propagation uses configuration properties and a simple API to send and receive deltas.

## <a id="delta-propagation-api__section_5787FD2053544B2AB6E7DCC3CEC14204" class="no-quick-link"></a>.NET - for C&#35;

Your application class must implement:

-   `Apache::Geode::Client::IGFDelta `
-   `Apache::Geode::Client::IGFSerializable `

`IGFDelta` provides the methods, `HasDelta`, `ToDelta`, and `FromDelta`, which you program to report on, send, and receive deltas for your class.

Additionally, for cloning, your class must implement the standard .NET `IClonable` interface and its `Clone` method. See [Cloning](delta-propagation-properties.html#delta-propagation-properties).

## <a id="delta-propagation-api__section_F3F89A01A4084D3092B88D16E43D8B37" class="no-quick-link"></a>C++

Your application must publicly derive from:

-   `apache::geode::client::Delta `

`Delta` provides the methods, `hasDelta`, `toDelta`, `fromDelta`, which you program to report on, send, and receive deltas for your class.

For cloning, use the `clone` method provided in the Delta interface. See [Cloning](delta-propagation-properties.html#delta-propagation-properties).
